I queried through a sales database for a record store, and these are some of the queries I wrote for them

1 How many Invoices were there in 2009

SELECT COUNT(invoiceid) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '%2009%';


2 List all customers who ordered on behalf of a company, and who was their sales agent

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.Company,
employees.FirstName AS Rep_first_name, employees.LastName AS Rep_last_name
FROM customers
JOIN employees
ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
WHERE customers.Company <> 'NULL';


3 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.Country,
employees.FirstName AS Rep_first_name, employees.LastName AS Rep_last_name,
SUM(invoices.Total)
FROM customers
JOIN employees
ON customers.SupportRepId = employees.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices
ON invoices.InvoiceId = customers.CustomerId
GROUP BY invoices.CustomerId;


4 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName,
 invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry
FROM customers
JOIN invoices
ON invoices.InvoiceId = customers.CustomerId;

5. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID

SELECT DISTINCT Tracks.Name, artists.Name, invoice_items.trackid FROM tracks
JOIN invoice_items
ON tracks.TrackId = invoice_items.TrackId
JOIN albums
ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId
JOIN artists
ON artists.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId;
