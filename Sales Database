In this SQL, I am querying a sales database

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers AS Cust
INNER JOIN FebSales AS Feb
ON Cust.order_id = Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT DISTINCT Product, price
FROM JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT MIN(price) FROM JanSales)

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as Revenue, Product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
select 

SELECT COUNT(Cus.acctnum), AVG(Feb.Quantity)*Feb.price AS AvgPrice
FROM FebSales AS Feb
JOIN customers AS Cus
ON Cus.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE Feb.Quantity >=2
AND length(Feb.orderID) = 6
AND Feb.orderID <> 'OrderID';
